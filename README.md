# Global-Chef

## Overview
 I Design this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Javascript. This is my second project I designed using HTML 5< CSS, Boostrap and Javascript 
 
## The Project Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Fill in all fields in the form
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during registration
- Enrol in a class
- Explore different classes and videos

 
## My process
The project is the second project I design from scratch using HTML 5, CSS, Boostrap, and Javascript and it took me one weeks to complete. I did the project to understand HTML, CSS and Javascript more. It has helped me improve my basic understanding of javascript, HtML, and CSS. I'm motivated me to build other challenging projects using React and other library.

## Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Boostrap 5
- CSS Grid
-Javascript
 
## What I learned
The project makes me understand Boostrap, CSS Framework better. Being my second project I built with HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Javascript I now have better understand of the framework.


## Continued development
I will love to do more projects using React library to improve my skills.
